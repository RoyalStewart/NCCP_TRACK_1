	<h1>
		Tools</h1>
	<p>
		The Nevada Climate Change Project has produced several software tools and systems.
		Software tools are created as a part of the research and development efforts
		of the project itself, and are released to the public to contribute to the pool
		of tools available to developers and researchers, improving their ability to more
		easily utilize climate change data.</p>
	<p>
		In terms of software systems, the Nevada Climate Change Project will create, as
		one of its primary goals, a framework for interconnecting climate models and data.
		This system – entitled &ldquo;The Demeter Framework&rdquo; – is designed to specifically address
		the need for researchers and climate modelers to create data processing pipelines,
		spanning multiple data sources, models, and processing steps.</p>
	<h2>
		The Demeter Framework</h2>
	<p>
		The Demeter Framework is a web-based framework that allows the user to create custom 
        scenarios for model coupling. By utilizing powerful web services, the user can access a 
        library of models, data sources, visualizations, and other activities that have been written 
        by scientists and programmers for use with this system. The system is user-driven, allowing developers and modelers from
		all over the world to register their models and data sources as &quot;activities&quot; for use, and couple
		those models with the existing activities already in the system. Currently, these activities
		can take the form of web services or .NET-compatible libraries.
	</p>
    <p>
        The main author of Demeter and its Persephone GUI interface is Eric Fritzinger, a UNR Computer Science and Engineering 
        R&amp;D faculty and software professional. He can be contacted at <a href="mailto:ericf@cse.unr.edu">ericf@cse.unr.edu</a>.
    </p>
    

    <h2>
		The SUNPRISM Framework</h2>
	<p>
        The SUNPRISM framework defines an approach and provides tools aimed at supporting scientific 
        investigation via new capabilities for combining data transformations, model simulations, 
        and output visualizations in application scenarios developed for climate change research.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main author of SUNPRISM is Sohei Okamoto, who developed it part of his PhD in Computer Science 
        and Engineering at UNR. Sohei can be contacted at 
        <a href="mailto:sohei.okamoto@gmail.com">sohei.okamoto@gmail.com</a>.

    <h2>
        The Web Enabled Date & Modeling Toolkit</h2>
    <p>
        Web Enabled Date & Modeling Toolkit (WEDMIT) is a combination of a web enabled 
        application with a cross platform desktop application. WEDMIT is primarily aimed 
        to address the data and model interoperability challenges. Researchers in 
        environmental sciences work with datasets that have a large variety of data 
        structures and file formats. Consequently, for data and model interoperability, 
        it is essential to have the right tools for converting from a given data structure 
        to another, and from a specific file format to another. WEDMIT is an original 
        web-enabled approach for generating data processors capable of handling a multitude 
        of data operations, including numerous data conversion and processing activities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The main author of the WEDMIT is Jigar Patel, who developed it as part of his Ph.D. in 
        Computer Science and Engineering at UNR. Jigar can be contacted at 
        <a href="mailto:jspatel@cse.unr.edu">jspatel@cse.unr.edu</a>.

    <h2>
		The VISTED Tool</h2>
    <p>
        VISTED is a visualization toolset for environmental data. The main goal of 
        the VISTED is to help the climate researchers in visualizing the datasets 
        and also giving them the flexibility in choosing the data of their interest.   
        VISTED tool suite includes new capabilities such as data extraction and 
        interoperability of various data formats. The tool will allow users to extract, 
        view, download, and visualize data. It will input and download data in netCDF, 
        ASCII, HDF5, and CSV formats. The time series charts, and maps will help in 
        visualizing the data. And finally, to support several browsers, operating 
        systems, and hardware devices HTML5 is adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main author of the VISTED is Likhitha Ravi, who developed it as part of her research assistantship in the 
        Computer Science and Engineering department at UNR. Likhitha can be contacted at 
        <a href="mailto:likhitha.ravi@gmail.com">likhitha.ravi@gmail.com</a>.

    <h2>
		The ATMOS Toolkit</h2>
    <p>
        The ATMOS toolkit provides Access to Tabular and Map-based Online Services.  It is an 
        ASP.NET web application that aggregates climate change data from various web services 
        and presents that data in a uniform way to researchers.  The toolkit uses a set of 
        plugins to provide access to various data sources, and can be extended by writing new 
        plugins to access additional data sources.  The fact that multiple disparate services 
        are being accessed through multiple plugins is transparent to the end user, who accesses 
        data through the web front-end.
    </p>
        <p>
        The main author of ATMOS is Andrew Dittrich, who developed it as part of his master's thesis 
        in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Reno.  Andrew can be contacted at 
        <a href="mailto:andy.dittrich@gmail.com">andy.dittrich@gmail.com</a>
