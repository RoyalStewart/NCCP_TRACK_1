        The Nevada Climate-ecohydrological Assessment Network (N<span class="h1-lowcase">ev</span>CAN)</h1>
    <p>
        The Universities of Nevada (Las Vegas and Reno) and the Desert Research Institute
        have collaborated with land owner agencies in Nevada to establish two elevational
        transects of monitoring stations named the Nevada Climate-ecohydrology Assessment
        Network (NevCAN). The primary purpose of NevCAN is to collect data for long-term
        assessment of climate variability and change in Nevada and its impact on ecological
        and hydrological processes and function.</p>
    <p>
        These basin-to-mountain top transects are located in the Sheep Range (located approximately
        35 km NNW of Las Vegas) and in the Snake Range (east central NV along the UT border;
        approximately 335 km NNE of Las Vegas). The Sheep Range transect has five monitoring
        stations beginning at 900 m and ending at 3015 m (Hayford Peak). All of these monitoring
        stations are located on land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and several
        of the stations are co-located with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS)
        Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) sites. The Snake Range transect has seven monitoring
        stations beginning at 1790 m on the west side of the range, 3355 m at the western
        subalpine site and ending at 1560 m on the eastern side of the range. An 8th monitoring
        station at 1564 m (Salt Desert, west) will be incorporated into the Snake Range
        transect as funding permits; this site has had an operational eddy covariance system
        since 2007. The Snake Range transect encompasses several collaborating land holder
        agencies including: the Long Now Foundation, Bureau of Land Management, Great Basin
        National Park and the Nevada Land Conservancy.</p>
    <p>
        Monitoring stations are located in the elevational &quot;middle&quot; of each major
        plant community/vegetation type along each transect. Table 1 below lists the plant
        community zone, predominant plant species and altitude for each monitoring station.

                title="Diagram illustrating a major way that the NevCAN is designed to function. The x-axis represents time (two years depicted) and the y-axis represents space (latitude and elevation). The mountain ranges making up the southern (lower green hill) and northern (upper white-topped green hill) transects symbolically show elevation and location of the transect sites (filled blue circles). Extending directly to the right (i.e., moving through time) from each site is a set of lines symbolizing weather and other environmental data that are being, and will continue to be, automatically logged every 10 min. Along the upper x-axis, weather events (E1â€”En) are shown. If an event occurs at a site, a red-filled circle denotes when the event occurred and at what site(s). The gray-filled circles to the right of an event denote the time of a sequential response to that event. Circles that remain on the data lines indicate that responses have been noted only at that site for the event. Connecting lines and gray-filled circles that move to the data line of another site indicate that the initial event has elicited a response at another site along the transect at a later time. Of course, there must be plausible explanations for connecting events and subsequent responses. Analytical and statistical tools can aid in evaluating behavior-over-time patterns (e.g., from daily patterns to longer timescales) as depicted in the yellow box. Ultimately, data analysis aims to help assess climate effects on ecosystem hydrology and ecology and aid in prediction of potential anthropogenic climate change effects.">
