        The ATMOS toolkit provides Access to Tabular and Map-based Online Services.  It is an 
        ASP.NET web application that aggregates climate change data from various web services 
        and presents that data in a uniform way to researchers.  The toolkit uses a set of 
        plugins to provide access to various data sources, and can be extended by writing new 
        plugins to access additional data sources.  The fact that multiple disparate services 
        are being accessed through multiple plugins is transparent to the end user, who accesses 
        data through the web front-end.

        The ATMOS toolkit's goal is to facilitate climate change research by providing a uniform 
        and consistent access method for the wide variety of climate change data sources that 
        exist, including both map-based data and tabular data.  These various data sources may 
        have different access methods, data formats, and metadata, which presents a challenging 
        environment for climate change researchers.  The ATMOS toolkit helps to create a consistent 
        interface, allowing researchers to focus on the data itself rather than how the data is 
        accessed.  The ATMOS toolkit also takes steps to provide metadata and links to the original 
        data source to support data provenance, and ensure that climate change research based on 
        this data will stand up to scrutiny from the scientific community.
