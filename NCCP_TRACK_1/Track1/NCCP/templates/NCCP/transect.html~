        Introduction to Transect Data</h2>
    <h3>
        What are transects and why monitor them?</h3>
    <p>
        Transect data research is a type of distance sampling. Distance sampling is a technique
        during which samples are collected on a designated transect line or points. Transect
        data can encompass either one or multiple variables from a monitored plot. Such
        data is typically monitored over a prolonged period of type and is ultimately available
        for comparison between multiple plots.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to accurately collect data, various sensor and monitoring equipment is
        implemented on site. Such equipment can measure change in temperature, weather,
        soil, surrounding plant and organism life. Depending on the course of study, equipment,
        plot size, location, and controls will vary. However, in general, transect data
        is used to study and monitor the course of long-term changes and fluctuations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transect sites can provide data for environmental research in the field of ecology,
        meteorology, climate change, etcetera.

        Why sample?</h3>

    <p>
        Prior to conducting a study, it is important to determine the type of data needed,
        the location of the sites and why. During an ecological study, it may be important
        to know what type of plant and animals are inhabiting a particular area. Thus, it
        will be important to sample the quantity of organisms, the availability of their
        habitat, the fluctuation of their population and other factors of interest. Ultimately,
        collected data can be used to evaluate and project fluctuations. Once your interest
        of study is established, it is important to determine what type of equipment, sensors,
        and monitors are required.</p>
