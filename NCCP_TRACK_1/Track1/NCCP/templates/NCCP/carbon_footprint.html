        Carbon Footprint</h2>

    <p>
        A carbon footprint is the overall environmental impact of a company, individual,
        society, organization, or product. Overall, this is the total amount of greenhouse
        gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed
        in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide (CO<span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span>).
        Definite calculations can prove to be nearly impossible due to the magnitude of
        associated variables.</p>
    <h3>
        Sources</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the carbon footprint emissions for the average U.S. household come from
        indirect sources. This means that a majority of the emissions that are produces
        do not involve the consumer; these are generally released during manufacturing or
        shipping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main influences on carbon footprints include population, economic output, and
        energy and carbon intensity of the economy.</p>
    <h3>
        Measurement</h3>
    <p>
        A carbon footprint estimate can help one understand their impact and the natural
        resources they use and/or waste. This measurement can be seen as an effective tool
        for setting lifestyle goals or changes to becoming more sustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Online calculators are available for individual use â€“ such calculators can provide
        an individual with an average count of planets necessary to sustain their lifestyle.
        While organizations may calculate the emissions associate with their process to
        produce a more accurate company profile.
