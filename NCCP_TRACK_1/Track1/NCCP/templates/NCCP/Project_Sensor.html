        The SENSOR System
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Spatial Engine for Nevada Scientific Observational Results (SENSOR) system 
        was created under the current NSF EPSCoR-funded RII (Track I) project to provide 
        an automated mechanism for the long-term acquisition, storage, management, and 
        curation of raw observational research data. This innovative system combines 
        complex software systems, state-of-the-art hardware, and an advanced geospatial 
        database system to provide high-quality, lossless, verifiable data streams and 
        auto-generated metadata to project stakeholders, including researchers, 
        students, and the public. Designed for extensibility and performance, this 
        system is intended to support current and future research efforts throughout 
        Nevada via cutting-edge technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The front end of the SENSOR system is the Nevada Climate Change Portal (NCCP), 
        which openly provides data and information to a variety of users: scientists, 
        educators, students, policy makers, and the general public. To enhance the use 
        and comprehension of this data and information, the NCCP incorporates a variety 
        of other documents, features, services, and tools, such as data visualizations, 
        tutorial videos, and search interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Internally, the SENSOR system utilizes various software processes to securely 
        store and import data from various data sources (e.g., data loggers), performing 
        basic data integrity checks. Basic quality assurance processes asynchronously 
        evaluate collected data, indicating whether the data is viable or potentially 
        erroneous. Data curation services periodically verify the integrity of raw data 
        files, aggregating and organizing them to simplify management and storage. 
        Ensuring data redundancy, frequent backup processes duplicate the database and 
        raw data files to one or more geographically-separate locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many data repositories quickly become a graveyard of abandoned, 
        largely-undocumented post-processed data submitted by researchers at the end of 
        their projects. The SENSOR system collects, curates, documents, and provides all 
        raw data to each researcher for their individual use and analysis. This 
        significantly reduces the involvement of the researchers in data collection 
        activities while simultaneously providing an unprecedented level of 
        verifiability, security, and metadata to ensure the data is completely reusable 
        and identifiable by current and future researchers.
