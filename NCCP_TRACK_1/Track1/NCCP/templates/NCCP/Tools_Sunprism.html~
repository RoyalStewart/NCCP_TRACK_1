    </p>
	<p>
        The SUNPRISM framework defines an approach and provides tools aimed at supporting scientific 
        investigation via new capabilities for combining data transformations, model simulations, 
        and output visualizations in application scenarios developed for climate change research.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consisting of two specialized software tools, the SUNPRISM Scenario Manager and the SUNPRISM Visualizer, 
        SUNPRISM frameworkâ€™s defining characteristics are a visual, user-friendly object-based 
        interface for scenario configuration; a workflow-based environment that allows code generation 
        and dataflow scenario execution; and data visualization capabilities for 3D environments, 
        including for immersive virtual environments such as CAVE. 
    </p>
    <p>
        An application scenario consists of a combination of data resource objects and computational 
        activity objects and, procedurally, there are five modes of operation in SUNPRISM: resource 
        registration, scenario configuration, automated scenario code generation, scenario execution, 
        and data examination.
