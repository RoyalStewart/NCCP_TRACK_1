    <h2>
        Wind Speed</h2>
    <h3>
        The importance of studying wind velocity</h3>
    <p>
        Wind speed, or wind velocity, is significant to weather forecasting and affects
        other major functions such as the air transportation of pollen, the metabolism rate
        of plant species, and other anthropogenic factors. Wind speed can also be used to
        determine the onset of a new season or major weather occurrence. Wind velocity is
        typically measured with an anemometer, which is a common weather station instrument.
        Anemometers can be used to measure wind speed and pressure, variables that are very
        important to predicting weather patterns.</p>
    <p>
        Wind speed is affected by various micro and macro factors, such as pressure gradient.
        Pressure gradient is defined as the difference in the air pressure between two atmospheric
        points. Essentially, the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the wind
        will flow from a high to low pressure atmosphere to balance out the fluctuation.
        Factors like hurricanes, tornadoes and monsoons can regionally and locally influence
        wind speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Discovering Physical Geography by Alan F. Arbogast, wind direction
        and velocity are influenced by following primary factors:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Pressure gradient</dt>
        <dd>
            The difference in barometric pressure between adjacent zones of high and low pressure.</dd>
        <dt>Frictional forces</dt>
        <dd>
            Features on the Earth's surface which oppose the wind; e.g.: mountains, trees, buildings,
            etc.</dd>
        <dt>Coriolis effect</dt>
        <dd>
            The Earth's rotation causes winds to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere,
            and in the Southern Hemisphere to the left.</dd>

        The sensor used to measure and report wind speed and direction on the NCCP website
        is called a propeller anemometer, specifically the RM Young Wind Vane. This model
        is corrosion-resistant and ideal for a wide range of wind measuring applications.
        The wind speed sensor is a four blade helicoid propeller. The propeller rotation
        produces an AC sine wave voltage signal. The wind direction sensor is a rugged yet
        lightweight vane. Vane angle is sensed by a precision potentiometer. Constructed
        of UV stabilized plastic with stainless steel and anodized aluminum fittings, the
        sensor mounts on standard 1 inch pipe (Young USA). This type of equipment is designed
        for operating temperatures -50 to 50Â°C, making it an ideal piece of equipment in
        Nevada weather.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected from this sensor is made public on the NCCP website. Simply chose
        your desired range, time frame and measurement units.
